# Lecture 4

##  !
  - Refer to "non null assertion operator"
  - Here we tell angular that my variable will take value but not now.

##  Services
  - Singleton Design Pattern 
  - Create Only One Instance
  - All Components Can Watch This Instance
  - To generate a new Angular Service, use the following command:  

```bash
ng g service "Service_Name"
```


##  Routes
We use routes to navigate between pages and change component to be displayed.
  - Routes Array follows "First match win" Principle.
  - We need to put "not found" route at the tail of the array.
